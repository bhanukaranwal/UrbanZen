## Overview

UrbanZen is a comprehensive, secure, and fault-tolerant IoT ecosystem designed to transform city infrastructure management in India. The platform supports multi-utility services (water, electricity, transport) with cutting-edge hardware, AI-powered analytics, secure cloud architecture, and intuitive interfaces.

## Architecture

### Microservices Architecture
- **API Gateway** - Central entry point with authentication and routing
- **Device Management** - IoT device registration and monitoring
- **Data Ingestion** - Real-time data processing with Kafka
- **Analytics** - AI/ML models for predictions and insights
- **Notification** - Multi-channel notification system
- **User Management** - Authentication and RBAC
- **Billing** - Utility billing and payment processing
- **Reporting** - Government compliance reports

### Frontend Applications
- **Admin Dashboard** (React + TypeScript) - Real-time monitoring
- **Citizen Mobile App** (Flutter) - Cross-platform mobile app
- **Field Officer App** (React Native) - Maintenance teams
- **Public Dashboard** (Next.js) - Public transparency

### Database Architecture
- **TimescaleDB** - Time-series sensor data
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational data with PostGIS
- **MongoDB** - Unstructured data
- **Redis** - Caching and sessions
- **InfluxDB** - High-frequency metrics

## Quick Start
